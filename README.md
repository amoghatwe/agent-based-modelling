# Poker Agents Trading Bot

This project is a way to evaluate the best strategies in trading on financial markets, it will revolve around 4 main playstyles: Loose-Aggressive, Loose-Passive, Tight-Aggressive, and Tight-Passive.

The project will start off evaluating these strategies on a market-simulation.

The project is currently in it's most nascent stage, I will be evaluating the mathematical literature behind these strategies and then apply them through Python and/or C++ at a later stage.
